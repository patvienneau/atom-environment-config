## 1.0.0
- add `Allow Pending` option.
- update setting names
- better logic to handle single click and double click

The reason adding `Allow Pending` option is that if turn off `Allow Pending Pane Items` in core setting, `github` package will keep multi blank `unstaged changes` panes open after stage. If `Allow Pending` of this package is set to false, user can open the file in permanent pane by single click and not have the blank pane problem of github package.

### 1.0.1
- update readme
